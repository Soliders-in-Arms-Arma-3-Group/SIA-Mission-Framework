# SIA-Mission-Framework (Alpha v0.7.6)

  The SIA Mission Framework is a comprehensive template for mission makers, allowing for the easy addition and configuration of numerous scripts and QoL features.

  The SIA Mission Framework is intended to be used with the "SIA Mission Framework Template" available off the Steam Workshop here: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2595033761

How to use:

  1. Ensure you are subscribed to "SIA Mission Framework Template" linked above.
  2. Download the latest release of the "SIA-Mission-Framework.VR" from here on Github.
  3. Launch Arma 3 and open a blank map you intended to use for your mission. Go to "Scenario" > "Save", and save as the name of your mission.
  4. Determine where the players will spawn in, navigate to Steam-subscribed compositions, and place down the "SIA Mission Framework Template". (Read the cyan comment bubbles for more information on each component of the composition).
  5. If using the optional player template, you can edit the attributes of the unit to switch them to your desired faction for the players.
  6. Go to "Scenario" > "Open Scenario Folder". This will bring up your mission's folder where all data will go.
  7. Open up the "SIA-Mission-Framework.VR" you downloaded from Github previously.
  8. Move all contents from the "SIA-Mission-Framework.VR" into your mission's folder, except the "mission.sqm".
  9. Navigate the "# MISSION CONFIG" folder in your mission's folder. This is the folder where you will configure settings and set up scripts for your mission.
  10. Open the "settings" and "missionInfo" files, and configure the settings relevant to your mission.
  11. Optionally, you can set up role specific arsenals using the "localArsenalConfig" file.
  12. Make your mission as usual.
  13. When ready, type up your briefing for the side(s) the players will be playing as.
  
In game:
  The SIA Mission Framework makes use of a powerful feature, Zeus ACE Actions, which adds additional actions for the game master they can use. This includes the important "Start Mission" action which the Game Master will use to disable the safeStart script.
